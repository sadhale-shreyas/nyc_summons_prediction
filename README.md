<h2>Introduction:</h2>
The project centers around a detailed exploration of the NYC Criminal Summons Data, providing comprehensive insights into various infractions and demographic characteristics. The dataset encompasses details on offenses such as disorderly premises, careless driving, trespassing, along with topographical information like borough, precinct, and coordinates, and demographic factors like age group, sex, and race. With 22 columns and 21.7K rows, the dataset offers a diverse range of information, making it suitable for thorough analysis.

<h2>Project Objective:</h2>
To achieve its objectives, the project employs multiple analytical methods, including descriptive statistics, data visualization, statistical analysis, and temporal analysis. These methods aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends within the dataset. The rationale for selecting this dataset lies in its availability, relevance to law enforcement, inclusion of geographic and demographic factors, coverage of various infractions, and potential societal impact, particularly in the realms of social justice, crime prevention, and resource allocation.

<h2>Methodology:</h2>
The Python libraries utilized for the analysis include Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Requests, and Matplotlib. Through exploratory data analysis, the team gains insights into the distribution of offenses across different demographics, temporal trends, and geographic locations. The data cleaning process addresses null values, ensuring the dataset's reliability and accuracy for subsequent analyses.

<h2>Visualizations:</h2>
<p>The project formulates several key questions for investigation, such as the distribution of summons categories across demographics, monthly trends in summons issuance, and the distribution of summons category types across boroughs. Various visualizations, including line graphs, histograms, pie charts, and bar graphs, help represent age group distributions, monthly trends, gender distribution, racial demographics, and more.</p>

<h2>Machine Learning Models</h2>
<p>The predictive modeling phase introduces KNN Classification and Random Forest Classification models to predict summons category types based on selected features. The Random Forest model stands out with an impressive accuracy of 97.1%, showcasing its effectiveness in categorizing summons based on specified features. This predictive capability offers valuable insights into understanding and analyzing the nature of various summonses issued in NYC.</p>
